# Some computers exist with a 64bit cpu but a 32bit efi implementation.
# we can't install both grub-efi-amd64 and grub-efi-ia32 at the same time
# by calling both of them from standard.list.binary.
# installing grub-efi-ia32 from another file allows both the deb files
# to be available in the final iso file.
# the installer will know which one to use.
