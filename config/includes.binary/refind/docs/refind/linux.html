<p>Windows and Mac OS X both provide relatively simple EFI boot loader programs. Launch them, and if they're launched from the correct locations and have the correct files in place, they'll boot their respective OSes. This makes rEFInd's job easy; it just locates the boot loader program files and runs them.</p>

<p>Under Linux, by contrast, things can get complicated. As detailed on my <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/index.html">Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux</a> page, several different EFI boot loaders for Linux exist, and all of them require configuration. If you're lucky, your distribution will have set up a Linux boot loader in a sensible way, in which case rEFInd should detect it and it will work as easily as a Windows or Mac OS X boot loader. If you're not lucky, though, you may need to configure it further. rEFInd offers options to help out with this task. Naturally, rEFInd supports <a href="#traditional">traditional Linux boot loaders.</a> It works even better with the Linux EFI stub loader, so I provide <a href="#quickstart">instructions on starting with it.</a> For those interested in manual configuration, I also provide <a href="#efistub">detailed instructions</a> on how the EFI stub support works and how to configure it.</p>

<a name="traditional">
<h2>Using a Traditional Linux Boot Loader</h2>
</a>

<p>I consider <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/elilo.html">ELILO</a>, <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/grub_legacy.html">GRUB Legacy</a>, <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/grub2.html">GRUB 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/syslinux.html">SYSLINUX</a> to be traditional Linux boot loaders. These programs all exist independent of the Linux kernel, but they can load a kernel and hand off control to it. All four programs have their own configuration files that reside in the same directory as the boot loader itself (or optionally elsewhere, in the case of GRUB 2).</p>

<p>Ordinarily, rEFInd will detect these traditional boot loaders and provide main menu entries for them. If the boot loader exists in a directory with a name that matches a Linux distribution's icon filename, you'll automatically get a distribution-specific icon to refer to the boot loader.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can disable automatic scanning and create an entry in <tt>refind.conf</tt> for your distribution, as described on the <a href="configfile.html">Configuring the Boot Manager</a> page. This method is harder to set up but can be preferable if you want to customize your options.</p>

<a name="quickstart">
<h2>Using the EFI Stub Loader: Three Configuration Options</h2>
</a>

<p>The EFI stub loader is basic and reliable, but it requires some setup to use it on some computers. It also requires that you run a kernel with the same bit width as your EFI. In most cases, this means running a 64-bit kernel, since 32-bit EFI-based computers are so rare. I describe three methods of using the EFI stub loader: an <a href="#easiest">easiest method</a> for those with compatible partition and filesystem layouts, a <a href="#testing">quick test configuration</a> for those without such a layout, and <a href="#reconfigure">a long-term setup</a> for those without the ideal setup.</p>

<a name="easiest">
<h3>For Those With Foresight or Luck: The Easiest Method</h3>
</a>

<p>This method requires that your <tt>/boot</tt> directory, whether it's on a separate partition or is a regular directory in your root (<tt>/</tt>) filesystem, be readable by the EFI. At the moment, all EFI implementations can read FAT and Macs can read HFS+. By using <a href="drivers.html">drivers,</a> you can make any EFI read HFS+, ISO-9660, ReiserFS, ext2fs, ext3fs, ext4fs, or Btrfs. Thus, if you use any of these filesystems on a regular partition (not an LVM or RAID configuration) that holds your kernels in <tt>/boot</tt>, you qualify for this easy method. The default partition layouts used by Ubuntu, Fedora, and many other distributions qualify, because they use one of these filesystems (usually ext4fs) in a normal partition or on a separate <tt>/boot</tt> partition. You must also have a 3.3.0 or later Linux kernel with EFI stub support, of course.</p>

<p>If you installed rEFInd 0.6.0 or later with its <tt>install.sh</tt> script from your regular Linux installation, chances are everything's set up; you should be able to reboot and see your Linux kernels as boot options. If you installed manually, from OS X, or from an emergency system, though, you may need to do a couple of things manually:

<ul>

<li>Copy the relevant driver file for your filesystem and architecture to
    the <tt>drivers</tt> or <tt>drivers_<tt class="variable">arch</tt></tt>
    subdirectory of the rEFInd installation directory on the EFI System
    Partition (ESP). You may need to create this subdirectory, too.</li>

<li>Create a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file in your <tt>/boot</tt>
    directory. The <tt>mkrlconf.sh</tt> script that comes with rEFInd
    should do this job, or you can do it manually as described <a
    href="#efistub">later.</a> Starting with version 0.6.12, rEFInd can
    create minimal boot options from <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, if <tt>/boot</tt>
    is <i>not</i> a separate partition, so a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt>
    file may not be strictly necessary. It remains desirable, though, and
    is necessary if <tt>/boot</tt> is on a separate partition or if you
    need unusual kernel options to boot your computer.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you reboot, you should see rEFInd options for your Linux kernels. If they work, your job is done, although you might want to apply some of the tweaks described in the <a href="#reconfigure">maintenance-free setup</a> section. If you have problems, you may need to adjust the <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file, as described in the <a href="#efistub">detailed configuration section.</a></p>

<a name="testing">
<h3>Preparing a Test Configuration</h3>
</a>

<p>If you're not sure you want to use the EFI stub loader in the long term, you can perform a fairly quick initial test of it. This procedure assumes that you have access to a 3.3.0 or later Linux kernel with EFI stub support compiled into it. (Fedora 17, Ubuntu 12.10, and probably other distributions ship with such kernels.) Creating this configuration poses no risk to your current boot options, provided you don't accidentally delete existing files. The procedure for a quick test is:</p>

<ol>

<li>Copy your kernel file (<tt>vmlinuz-*</tt>) and matching initial RAM
    disk file (<tt>init*</tt>) from <tt>/boot</tt> to a subdirectory of
    <tt>EFI</tt> on your ESP. Your distribution's directory there should
    work fine. For instance, typing <tt class="userinput">cp
    /boot/vmlinuz-3.6.7-4.fc17.x86_64
    /boot/initramfs-3.6.7-4.fc17.x86_64.img /boot/efi/EFI/redhat</tt> might
    do the trick on a Fedora system, although you'll probably have to
    adjust the version numbers. Note that the filename forms vary from one
    distribution to another, so don't worry if yours look different from
    these. Be sure that you match up the correct files by version number,
    though.</li>

<li>Copy the <tt>/boot/refind_linux.conf</tt> file to the same directory to
    which you copied your kernel. If this file doesn't exist, create it by
    running (as <tt>root</tt>) the <tt>mkrlconf.sh</tt> script that came
    with rEFInd. This step may not be strictly necessary if <tt>/boot</tt>
    is an ordinary directory on your root (<tt>/</tt>) partition.</li>

<li>Reboot. You should now see a new entry for launching the Linux kernel
    that you copied. Try the option. If it works, great. If not, you may
    need to adjust your <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file. See the <a
    href="#efistub">detailed configuration section</a> for a description of
    this file's format. If the kernel begins to boot but complains that it
    couldn't find its root filesystem, double-check the version numbers on
    your kernel and initial RAM disk file, and check the <tt>root=</tt>
    option in <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt>.</li>

</ol>

<p>You can continue to boot your computer with this type of configuration; however, the drawback is that you'll need to copy your kernel whenever it's updated. This can be a hassle. A better way is to configure you system so that the EFI, and therefore rEFInd, can read your Linux <tt>/boot</tt> directory, where most Linux distributions place their kernels.</p>

<a name="reconfigure">
<h3>If You Need to Reconfigure Your Partitions....</h3>
</a>

<p>If your <tt>/boot</tt> directory happens to be on an XFS or JFS partition that the EFI can't read, or it's tucked away in an LVM or RAID configuration that the EFI can't read, you won't be able to use the <a href="#easiest">easiest solution.</a> Fortunately, this problem can be overcome with relatively little fuss. Several variant procedures are possible, but I begin by describing one that will almost always work, although it's got some important caveats (described at the end). You should perform the following steps as <tt>root</tt>, or precede each of these commands with <tt>sudo</tt>:</p>

<ol>

<li>Begin with your ESP mounted at <tt>/boot/efi</tt>, which is the most
    common location. If it's not mounted there, type <tt
    class="userinput">mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi</tt> to do so (adjusting
    <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>, if necessary), or mount it elsewhere and adjust the
    paths in the following procedure as necessary.</li>

<li>Check the size of the ESP by typing <tt class="userinput">df -h
    /boot/efi</tt>. The ESP must be large enough to hold several Linux
    kernels and initial RAM disk files&mdash;100MiB at a bare minimum, and
    preferably 200&ndash;500MiB.</li>

<li>Check your <tt>/boot</tt> directory to be sure it contains no links or
    other files that rely on Unix/Linux-style permissions or ownership. If
    it does, don't proceed, or at least research these files further to
    determine if you can work around the need for such permissions and
    ownership.</li>

<li>Type <tt class="userinput">cp -r /boot/* /boot/efi</tt>. You'll see an
    error message about being unable to copy <tt>/boot/efi</tt> into
    itself. Ignore this.</li>

<li>Type <tt class="userinput">umount /boot/efi</tt>.</li>

<li>Edit <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and change the mount point for
    <tt>/boot/efi</tt> to <tt>/boot</tt>. If the ESP isn't present in
    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, you must create an entry for it, with a mount
    point of <tt>/boot</tt>.</li>

<li>Type <tt class="userinput">mount -a</tt> to re-mount everything,
    including <tt>/boot</tt>. Check that your normal <tt>/boot</tt> files
    are all present, along with the new <tt>/boot/EFI</tt> directory, which
    holds what used to be <tt>/boot/efi/EFI</tt>. If something seems to be
    missing (other than <tt>/boot/efi</tt> with a lowercase <tt>efi</tt>),
    then you should try to correct the problem.</li>

<li>If it doesn't already exist, create a file called
    <tt>/boot/refind_linux.conf</tt> and populate it with kernel options,
    as described <a href="#refind_linux">later.</a> If this file doesn't
    already exist, the easiest way to create it is to run the
    <tt>mkrlconf.sh</tt> script that comes with rEFInd 0.5.1 and
    later.</li>

<li>Check your <tt>refind.conf</tt> file (presumably in
    <tt>/boot/EFI/refind</tt>) to be sure that the
    <tt>scan_all_linux_kernels</tt> line is uncommented. If it's not,
    uncomment that line.</li>

<li>Optionally, type <tt class="userinput">cp
    /boot/EFI/refind/icons/os_<i>name</i>.icns /boot/.VolumeIcon.icns</tt>
    to give loaders in <tt>/boot</tt> an icon for your distribution.</li>

<li>Reboot to test that this configuration works.</li>

</ol>

<p>Recall that in step #4, you <i>copied</i> the contents of <tt>/boot</tt> (as a safety measure), but you did not move them. Therefore, you ended up with two copies of your kernels and other <tt>/boot</tt> directory contents, with one copy hiding the other when you mounted the ESP at <tt>/boot</tt>. Once you've booted successfully and are sure all is working well, you can recover some disk space by unmounting <tt>/boot</tt> and deleting the contents of the underlying <tt>/boot</tt> directory on your root (<tt>/</tt>) filesystem. Be sure that the <tt>/boot</tt> partition is unmounted before you do this, though! Also, be sure to leave the <tt>/boot</tt> directory itself in place, even if it has no contents; the directory is needed as a mount point for the <tt>/boot</tt> partition. Note that GRUB 2 may stop working if you delete its files from the root filesystem's <tt>/boot/grub</tt> directory, so if you want to keep GRUB around, you should re-install it with the separate <tt>/boot</tt> partition mounted.</p>

<p>Once this task is done, updates to your kernel will automatically be stored in the root directory of your ESP, where rEFInd will automatically detect them. Thus, the boot configuration becomes maintenance-free. The procedure as just described has some drawbacks, though. By placing your kernels in the root directory of your ESP, you render them vulnerable to any other OS with which you might be dual-booting. Your ESP must also be large enough to hold all your kernels. If you dual-boot with multiple Linux distributions, they might conceivably overwrite each others' kernels, and distinguishing one from another becomes more difficult.</p>

<p>For these reasons, a variant of this procedure is desirable on some systems. Most of the steps are similar, but in this variant, you create a separate <tt>/boot</tt> partition that's independent of the ESP. This partition can use FAT, HFS+, ReiserFS, ext2fs, ext3fs, ext4fs, or Btrfs; but if you use any of the last six filesystems (five on Macs), you must install the matching EFI filesystem driver that ships with rEFInd. Creating the filesystem will normally require you to shrink an existing partition by a suitable amount (200&ndash;500MiB). Mount your new <tt>/boot</tt> partition at a temporary location, copy or move the current <tt>/boot</tt> files into it, unmount it, and add it to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> as <tt>/boot</tt>.</p>

<p>If your distribution already uses a separate <tt>/boot</tt> partition, but if it uses XFS or some other unsuitable filesystem, you can back it up, create a fresh FAT, HFS+, ReiserFS, Btrfs, ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem on it, and restore the original files. You'll probably need to adjust the UUID value in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to ensure that the computer mounts the new filesystem when you boot. If you use a separate non-ESP <tt>/boot</tt> partition, you'll probably want to continue mounting the ESP at <tt>/boot/efi</tt>.</p>

<h2>EFI Stub Loader Support Technical Details</h2>
</a>

<p>The Linux <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/efistub.html">EFI stub loader</a> is a way to turn a Linux kernel into an EFI application. In a sense, the kernel becomes its own boot loader. This approach to booting Linux is very elegant in some ways, but as described on the page to which I just linked, it has its disadvantages, too. One challenge to booting in this way is that modern Linux installations typically require that the kernel be passed a number of options at boot time. These tell the kernel where the Linux root (<tt>/</tt>) filesystem is, where the initial RAM disk is, and so on. Without these options, Linux won't boot. These options are impossible for a generic boot loader to guess without a little help. It's possible to build a kernel with a default set of options, but this is rather limiting. Thus, rEFInd provides configuration options to help.</p>

<p>With all versions of rEFInd, you can create manual boot loader stanzas
in the <tt>refind.conf</tt> file to identify a Linux kernel and to pass it
all the options it needs. This approach is effective and flexible, but it
requires editing a single configuration file for all the OSes you want to
define in this way. If a computer boots two different Linux distributions,
and if both were to support rEFInd, problems might arise as each one tries
to modify its own rEFInd configuration; or the one that controls rEFInd
might set inappropriate options for another distribution. This is a problem
that's been a minor annoyance for years under BIOS, since the same
potential for poor configuration applies to LILO, GRUB Legacy, and GRUB 2
on BIOS. The most reliable solution under BIOS is to chainload one boot
loader to another. The same solution is possible under EFI, but rEFInd
offers another possibility.</p>

<p>rEFInd supports semi-automatic Linux EFI stub loader detection. This
feature works as part of the standard boot loader scan operation, but it
extends it as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>rEFInd looks for boot loaders whose names include the strings
    <tt>bzImage</tt> or <tt>vmlinuz</tt> and that end in <tt>.efi</tt>. For
    instance, <tt>bzImage-3.3.0.efi</tt> or <tt>vmlinuz-3.3.0-fc17.efi</tt>
    would match, and trigger subsequent steps in this procedure. Beginning
    with version 0.3.0, if you uncomment the
    <tt>scan_all_linux_kernels</tt> option in <tt>refind.conf</tt>, rEFInd
    will also scan for kernels <i>without</i> a <tt>.efi</tt> filename
    extension. This option is uncommented by default, but if you comment it
    out, delete it, or change it to read <tt>scan_all_linux_kernels 0</tt>,
    rEFInd won't scan for kernels that lack <tt>.efi</tt> filename
    extensions.</li>

<li>If a file's name ends in <tt>.efi.signed</tt>, any other file with an
    otherwise-identical name that <i>lacks</i> this extension is excluded.
    This peculiar rule exists because Ubuntu has begun delivering two
    copies of every kernel, one with and one without this extension. The
    one with the extension is signed with a Secure Boot key; the one
    without it is not so signed. Thus, if both files are present, the one
    without the key won't boot on a computer with Secure Boot active, and
    either will boot if Secure Boot is inactive. Thus, rEFInd excludes the
    redundant (unsigned) file in order to help keep the list of boot
    options manageable.</li>

<p class="sidebar">A kernel whose filename lacks a version string matches an initial RAM disk that also lacks a version string in its filename. Note that you can reliably use only <i>one</i> kernel and initial RAM disk per directory that lack version numbers in their filenames.</p>

<li>rEFInd looks for an initial RAM disk in the same directory as the
    kernel file. A matching initial RAM disk has a name that begins with
    <tt>init</tt> and that includes the same version string as the kernel.
    The version string is defined as the part of the filename from the
    first digit to the last digit, inclusive. Note that the version string
    can include non-digits. For instance, the version string for
    <tt>bzImage-3.3.0.efi</tt> is <tt>3.3.0</tt>, which matches
    <tt>initramfs-3.3.0.bz</tt>; and <tt>vmlinuz-3.3.0-fc17.efi</tt>'s
    version string is <tt>3.3.0-fc17</tt>, which matches
    <tt>initrd-3.3.0-fc17.img</tt>. Many other matches are possible. If an
    initial RAM disk is identified, rEFInd passes a suitable
    <tt>initrd=</tt> option to the kernel when it boots.</li>

<li>rEFInd looks for a file called <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> in the same
    directory as the kernel file. It consists of a series of lines,
    each of which consists of a label followed by a series of kernel
    options. The first line sets default options, and subsequent lines set
    options that are accessible from the main menu tag's submenu screen. If
    you installed rEFInd 0.5.1 or later with the <tt>install.sh</tt>
    script, that script created a sample <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file,
    customized for your computer, in <tt>/boot</tt>. This file will work
    without changes on many installations, but you may need to tweak it for
    some.</li>

<li>If rEFInd can't find a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file in the directory
    that holds the kernel, the program looks for a file called
    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> on the partition that holds the kernel. If this
    standard Linux file is present, rEFInd uses it to identify the root
    (<tt>/</tt>) filesystem and creates two sets of Linux kernel boot
    options: One set launches the kernel normally, but with minimal
    options, and the other set launches the kernel into single-user mode.
    This step can get a computer to boot without any rEFInd-specific
    configuration files, aside from <tt>refind.conf</tt> in rEFInd's own
    directory, but only if <tt>/boot</tt> is not a separate partition. The
    intent is to facilitate the use of rEFInd as an emergency boot manager
    or to help users who must install rEFInd from OS X or Windows. Note
    that rEFInd uses <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> only if <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt>
    is <i>not</i> found.</li>

</ol>

<p>The intent of this system is that distribution maintainers can place their kernels, initial RAM disks, and a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file in their own subdirectories on the ESP, on EFI-accessible <tt>/boot</tt> partitions, or in <tt>/boot</tt> directories on EFI-accessible Linux root (<tt>/</tt>) partitions. rEFInd will detect these kernels and create one main menu entry for each kernel. Each entry will implement as many options as there are lines in the <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file. In this way, two or more distributions can each maintain their boot loader entries, without being too concerned about who maintains rEFInd as a whole.</p>

<p>The <tt>scan_all_linux_kernels</tt> option is intended to help users and distribution maintainers when rEFInd is used in conjunction with a Linux filesystem driver for EFI or when the ESP is mounted as the Linux <tt>/boot</tt> partition. In these cases, if all the kernels in Linux's <tt>/boot</tt> directory include EFI stub loader support, rEFInd will automatically detect and use kernels installed in the usual way, such as via an automatic system update. You won't even need to move or rename your kernels. You will need to set up a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file and you may need to install a driver or set the <tt>also_scan_dirs</tt> option in <tt>refind.conf</tt>; but these are one-time requirements. Set up in this way, ongoing maintenance to handle kernel updates drops to zero!</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following file configuration:</p>

<pre class="listing">
$ <b>ls -l /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/</b>
total 17943
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4781632 2012-03-18 12:01 bzImage-3.3.0.efi
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   131072 2011-10-14 04:10 grubx64.EFI
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 13459936 2012-03-18 12:02 initrd.img-3.3.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      266 2012-03-26 19:39 refind_linux.conf
</pre>

<p>When rEFInd scans this directory, it will find two EFI boot loaders in <tt>EFI/ubuntu</tt>: <tt>grubx64.EFI</tt> and <tt>bzImage-3.3.0.efi</tt>. rEFInd will create two main-menu tags for these two loaders, one of which will launch Ubuntu's standard GRUB and the other of which will launch the 3.3.0 kernel file directly. The <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file contains a list of labels and options:</p>

<a name="refind_linux">
<pre class="listing">
"Boot with standard options" "root=/dev/sda3 ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7"
"Boot to single-user mode"   "root=UUID=1cd95082-bce0-494c-a290-d2e642dd82b7 ro single"
"Boot with minimal options"  "root=UUID=1cd95082-bce0-494c-a290-d2e642dd82b7 ro"
# "Boot alternate install"     "root=/dev/sdb9 ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7"
</pre>
</a>

<p>Ordinarily, both fields in this file must be enclosed in quotes. If you have to pass an option that includes quotes, you can do so by doubling up on them, as in <tt>"root=/dev/sdb9 my_opt=""this is it"""</tt>, which passes <tt>root=/dev/sdb9 my_opt="this is it"</tt> to the shell. You can include as much white space as you like between options. You can also place comments in the file, or remove an option by commenting it out with a leading hash mark (<tt>#</tt>), as in the fourth line in this example.</p>

<p>In the preceding example, the first line sets the options that rEFInd passes to the kernel by default (along with the name of the <tt>initrd.img-3.3.0</tt> file, since its version string matches that of the kernel). The next two lines set options that you can obtain by pressing Insert, F2, or + on the main menu, as shown here:</p>

    <br /><center><img src="automatic-submenu.png" align="center"
    width="471" height="189" alt="rEFInd can load Linux boot options from
    a refind_linux.conf file in the Linux kernel's directory."
    border=2></center><br />

<p>To assist in initial configuration, rEFInd's <tt>install.sh</tt> script creates a sample <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file in <tt>/boot</tt>. This sample file defines three entries, the first two of which use the default GRUB options defined in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> and the last of which uses minimal options. The first entry boots normally and the second boots into single-user mode. If you want to create a new file, you can use the <tt>mkrlconf.sh</tt> script that comes with rEFInd. If you pass it the <tt>--force</tt> option, it will overwrite the existing <tt>/boot/refind_linux.conf</tt> file; otherwise it will create the file only if one doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>From a user's perspective, the submenus defined in this way work just like submenus defined via the <tt>submenuentry</tt> options in <tt>refind.conf</tt>, or like the submenus that rEFInd creates automatically for Mac OS X or ELILO. There are, however, limitations in what you can accomplish with this method:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your kernels must be compiled with EFI stub loader support.</li>

<li>You can't set a submenu option to boot via a different boot loader,
    such as ELILO or GRUB; all the submenu options apply to a single boot
    loader&mdash;that is, a single kernel. (rEFInd will still detect other
    boot loaders and provide separate main-menu tags for them,
    though.)</li>

<li>If an installation includes two or more kernel files, each one receives
    its own main-menu entry; you can't combine them together in one menu
    item. This is essentially a corollary of the preceding limitation. The
    result can be an overburdened main menu if your system has many
    kernels.</li>

<li>All the kernels in a given directory use the same
    <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file. If you need to set different options
    for different kernels, you'll need to place those kernels in different
    directories.</li>

<li>You must place your kernels in a directory other than the one that
    holds the main rEFInd <tt>.efi</tt> file. This is because rEFInd does
    not scan its own directory for boot loaders.</li>

</ul>

<p>Ordinarily, a kernel booted in this way must reside on the ESP, or at least on another FAT partition. On a Macintosh, though, you can use HFS+ to house your kernel files. In fact, that may be necessary; my Mac Mini hangs when I try to boot a Linux kernel via an EFI stub loader from the computer's ESP, but it works fine when booting from an HFS+ partition. If you use <a href="drivers.html">EFI drivers,</a> though, you can place your kernel on any filesystem for which an EFI driver exists. This list is currently good (ext2fs/ext3fs, ext4fs, ReiserFS, Btrfs, ISO-9660, and HFS+), so chances are you'll be able to use this method to boot your kernel from your root (<tt>/</tt>) partition or from a <tt>/boot</tt> partition.</p>

<p>rEFInd sorts boot loader entries <i>within each directory</i> by time stamp, so that the most recent entry comes first. Thus, if you specify a directory name (or a volume label, for loaders stored in a volume's root directory) as the <tt>default_selection</tt>, rEFInd will make the most recent loader in the directory the default. This can obviate the need to adjust this configuration parameter when you add a new kernel; chances are you want the most recently-added kernel to be the default, and rEFInd makes it so when you set the <tt>default_selection</tt> in this way. If you <i>don't</i> want the latest kernel to become the default, you can use <tt>touch</tt> to give the desired kernel (or other boot loader) in the directory a more recent time stamp, or you can set <tt>default_selection</tt> to a value that uniquely identifies your desired default loader. One caveat you should keep in mind is that the EFI and Windows interpret the hardware clock as local time, whereas Mac OS X uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</a>. Linux can work either way. Thus, time stamps for boot loaders can be skewed by several hours depending on the environment in which they were created or last modified.</p>

<p class="sidebar"><b>Tip for distribution maintainers:</b> If you maintain an <tt>EFI/<tt class="variable">distname</tt></tt> directory for your kernels, you can place your version of rEFInd in a directory called <tt>EFI/<tt class="variable">distname</tt>/refind</tt>. This will avoid collisions with duplicate rEFInd installations from other distributions.</p>

<p>On the whole, this method of configuration has a lot going for it. For distribution maintainers, if you place your Linux kernel files (with EFI stub support) on the ESP, with suitable filenames, matching initial RAM disk files, and a <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> file, then any rEFInd 0.2.3 or later installation should detect your files, even if the user installs another distribution with another rEFInd that takes over from yours. (If the user, or this other rEFInd installation, disables auto-detection, this won't work.)</p>

<p>For end users, this method is simpler than maintaining manual configurations in <tt>refind.conf</tt> (or equivalents for ELILO or GRUB). To install a new kernel, you need only copy it and its initial RAM disk, under suitable names, to a scanned directory on the ESP. There's no need to touch any configuration file, provided you've already set up <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> in your kernel's directory. You will, however, have to adjust <tt>refind_linux.conf</tt> if you make certain changes, such as if your root directory identifier changes.</p>
