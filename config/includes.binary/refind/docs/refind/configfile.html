<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<div style="float:right; width:55%">

<p>Many casual users will be able to use rEFInd without making changes to its settings; in its default configuration, the boot manager automatically detects all the EFI boot loader programs you have on your EFI System Partition (ESP) (or your OS X boot partition, in the case of Macs) and displays icons for them. On Macs, rEFInd also presents legacy BIOS boot options by default. Sometimes, though, you may want to tweak rEFInd's configuration. Sometimes you can obtain your desired results by adjusting the filenames of your boot loaders. Other times, you can edit rEFInd's configuration file, <tt>refind.conf</tt>, which resides in the same directory as its binary file (<tt>refind_x64.efi</tt> or whatever you've renamed it).</p>

</div>

<div class="navbar">

<li class="tight"><a href="#submenu">Creating Submenu Entries</a></li>

</ul>

</div>

<p>Broadly speaking, rEFInd's configuration file is broken down into two sections: <i>global options</i> and <i>OS stanzas.</i> The global options section sets options that apply globally&mdash;to set the timeout period, enable graphics or text mode, and so on. OS stanzas are optional, but if present, they enable you to add new boot options or replace the auto-detected options with customized ones. Both sections include configuration lines and comment lines, the latter being denoted by a leading hash mark (<tt>#</tt>). rEFInd ignores comment lines, so you can add explanatory text. The default configuration file includes numerous comments explaining each of the options.</p>

<a name="hiding">
<h2>Hiding and Displaying EFI Boot Loaders</h2>
</a>

<p class="sidebar">ESPs use the FAT filesystem, which is case-insensitive. Unfortunately, at least one EFI implementation (Gigabyte's <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gb-hybrid-efi/">Hybrid EFI</a>) contains a bug that causes string comparisons that should be case-insensitive to actually be done in a case-sensitive way. This can cause files that are present to appear to be missing. rEFInd includes code to work around this bug in some situations, but not in all of them. If boot loaders appear to be missing, try changing the case on their filenames or on the <tt>EFI</tt> directory in the ESP. (It's coded as uppercase in rEFInd; but EFI loader filename extensions are coded as lowercase <tt>.efi</tt>. I made these choices because they seem to be the most common uses on real-world installations.)</p>

<p>Before delving into the configuration file, you should be aware of what you can do by renaming files. By default, rEFInd scans all the filesystems it can read for boot loaders. It scans most of the subdirectories of the <tt>EFI</tt> directory on every filesystem it can access for files with names that end in <tt>.efi</tt>. (rEFInd gives special treatment to the <tt>tools</tt> subdirectory, where it looks for system tools rather than boot loaders.)</p>

<p>If you're like me, you may sometimes want to hide a boot loader from rEFInd's menu for a brief period&mdash;say, because you're testing a variety of configurations but you don't want them all to clutter the menu at once. You might also want to hide a boot loader if you want to override its default settings using a custom entry in <tt>refind.conf</tt> and you don't want an automatic search to duplicate that entry. You can easily hide a boot loader by removing or changing its <tt>.efi</tt> filename extension&mdash;for instance, changing <tt>grub.efi</tt> to <tt>grub</tt>.</p>

<p>Another way to hide a boot loader is to move it into rEFInd's own directory. In order to keep rEFInd from showing up in its own menu, it ignores boot loaders in its own directory. This obviously includes the rEFInd binary file itself, but also anything else you might store there.</p>

<p>You can also use the <tt>dont_scan_volumes</tt>, <tt>dont_scan_dirs</tt>, and <tt>dont_scan_files</tt> tokens in <tt>refind.conf</tt> to hide entire volumes, directories, and individual files, respectively. Note that <tt>dont_scan_volumes</tt> works with both EFI and legacy scans, whereas the other two options make sense for hiding only EFI-mode boot loaders.</p>

<a name="icons">
<h2>Setting OS Icons</h2>
</a>

<p>In addition to hiding boot loaders, you can adjust their icons. You can do this in any of seven ways for auto-detected boot loaders:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can name an icon file after your boot loader, but with an extension of <tt>.icns</tt> or <tt>.png</tt> for ICNS-format and PNG-format icons, respectively. For instance, if you're using <tt class="variable">loader</tt><tt>.efi</tt>, you would name the icon file <tt class="variable">loader</tt><tt>.icns</tt>. (If you use the <tt>scan_all_linux_kernels</tt> option, you can give an icon for a Linux kernel without a <tt>.efi</tt> extension a name based on the kernel name but with a <tt>.icns</tt> or <tt>.png</tt> extension&mdash;for instance, <tt>bzImage-3.13.6.png</tt> will serve as the icon for the <tt>bzImage-3.13.6</tt> kernel.) These icon files should be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format">Apple's ICNS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</a> format, depending on the filename extension.</li>

<li>If you're booting OS X from its standard boot loader, or if you place a boot loader file for any OS in the root directory of a partition, you can create a file called <tt>.VolumeIcon.icns</tt> or <tt>.VolumeIcon.png</tt> that holds an icon file. OS X uses the <tt>.VolumeIcon.icns</tt> file for its volume icons, so rEFInd picks up these icons automatically, provided they include appropriate bitmaps.</li>

<li>You can place a boot loader in a directory with a name that matches one of rEFInd's standard icons, which take names of the form <tt>os_<tt class="variable">name</tt>.icns</tt> or <tt>os_<tt class="variable">name</tt>.png</tt>. To use such an icon, you would place the boot loader in the directory called <tt class="variable">name</tt>.</li>

<li>You can give the filesystem from which the boot loader is loaded a name that matches the OS name component of the icon filename. For instance, if you call your boot filesystem <tt>CentOS</tt>, it matches the <tt>os_centos.icns</tt> icon. This match is performed on a word-by-word basis within the name, with "words" being delimited by spaces, dashes (<tt>-</tt>), and underscores (<tt>_</tt>). Thus, a volume called <tt>Debian-boot</tt> will match <tt>os_debian.icns</tt> or <tt>os_boot.icns</tt>.</li>

<li>You can give the GPT partition from which the boot loader is loaded a name that matches the OS name component of the icon filename. This works much like the previous method, except that you'd use a tool like <tt>gdisk</tt> or <tt>parted</tt> to set the partition's name, rather than <tt>tune2fs</tt> or GParted to set the filesystem's name.</li>

<li>rEFInd attempts to guess the Linux distribution based on data in the <tt>/etc/os-release</tt> file. This file will only be accessible if a separate <tt>/boot</tt> partition is <i>not</i> used, though. Manually adjusting the <tt>os-release</tt> file to change an OS icon in rEFInd is <i>not</i> recommended.</li>

<li>Certain boot loaders have hard-coded icons associated with them. For instance, filenames beginning with <tt>vmlinuz</tt> or <tt>bzImage</tt> acquire Linux "Tux" icon and the <tt>bootmgfw.efi</tt> loader acquires a Windows icon. Fedora and Red Hat kernels can be identified by the presence of <tt>.fc</tt> or <tt>.el</tt> strings in their filenames, and so acquire suitable icons automatically. For the most part, these are the associations you want to overcome with the preceding rules, but sometimes renaming a boot loader to a more conventional name is the better approach. Renaming a locally-compiled kernel so that it acquires a Fedora or Red Hat icon is reasonable, but I don't recommend renaming precompiled kernels unless you also manually copy them to the ESP.</li>

</ul>

<p>As a special case, rEFInd assigns icons to the Windows and OS X boot loaders based on their conventional locations, so they get suitable icons even if they don't follow these rules.</p>

<p>In addition to the main OS tag icon, you can set the <i>badge</i> icon for a volume by creating a file called <tt>.VolumeBadge.icns</tt> or <tt>.VolumeBadge.png</tt> in the root directory of a partition. If present, it replaces the disk-type icons that are overlaid on the main OS icon. If you use this feature, the badge is applied to all the boot loaders read from the disk, not just those stored in the root directory or the Apple boot loader location. You could use this feature to set a custom badge for different specific disks or to help differentiate multiple OS X installations on one computer. If you don't want any badges, you can replace the three badge icons in the rEFInd <tt>icons</tt> subdirectory (<tt>vol_external.icns</tt>, <tt>vol_internal.icns</tt>, and <tt>vol_optical.icns</tt>) with a completely transparent badge. The <tt>transparent.icns</tt> file in the rEFInd <tt>icons</tt> directory may be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The default icon sizes are 128x128 pixels for OS icons, 48x48 pixels for the second-row tools, and 32x32 pixels for badges. You can change the sizes of the big OS icons and the small tool icons with the <tt>big_icon_size</tt> and <tt>small_icon_size</tt> tokens in <tt>refind.conf</tt>, as noted in <a href="#table1">Table 1.</a> The size of the disk-type badges is 1/4 the size of OS icons.</p>

<a name="adjusting">
<h2>Adjusting the Global Configuration</h2>
</a>

<p>You can adjust many of rEFInd's options by editing its configuration file. This file is called <tt>refind.conf</tt> by default; but you can use another filename by passing <tt>-c <tt class="variable">filename</tt></tt> as an option, as in <tt>refind_x64.efi -c myrefind.conf</tt> to use <tt>myrefind.conf</tt> in rEFInd's main directory. You can specify a configuration file in another directory, but to do so, you <i>must</i> use backslashes as directory separators, as in <tt>-c \EFI\other\refind.conf</tt>. This feature is intended for users who want to have rEFInd appear in its own menu, with the version launched in this way behaving differently from the original&mdash;for instance, to have a secondary rEFInd that provides boot options hidden by the main one. In this scenario, the default <tt>refind.conf</tt> would have a <a href="#stanzas">manual boot stanza</a> defining the new rEFInd instance, including its <tt>-c</tt> option.</p>

<p>You can use any text editor you like to edit <tt>refind.conf</tt>, but be sure it saves the file in plain ASCII text, not in a word processing format. (In theory, a UTF-16 encoding should also work, but this has been poorly tested.) Note that the EFI shell includes its own editor. If you need to make a change before you launch an OS, you can launch a shell, change to the rEFInd directory, and type <b><tt>edit refind.conf</tt></b> to edit the file. This EFI editor is quite primitive, but it gets the job done. After editing, you'll need to reboot or re-launch rEFInd for rEFInd to read the changed configuration file.</p>

<p>Global configuration file options consist of a name token followed by one or more parameters, as in:</p>

<pre class="listing">
timeout 20
</pre>

<p>This example's name token is <tt>timeout</tt> and its parameter is <tt>20</tt>. The net effect of this line is to set the timeout period to 20 seconds&mdash;rEFInd will wait 20 seconds before launching the default boot loader. Some options can take multiple parameters. These may be separated by commas, spaces, or tabs. The global options are summarized in the Table 1.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="2" summary="Table 1: Global options in <tt>refind.conf</tt>"><a name="table1"><caption><b>Table 1: Global options in <tt>refind.conf</tt></b></caption></a>

The tags appear in the order in which you specify them. The default is <tt>shell, memtest, gdisk, apple_recovery, mok_tool, about, shutdown, reboot, firmware</tt>. Note that the <tt>shell</tt>, <tt>memtest</tt>, <tt>apple_recovery</tt>, and <tt>mok_tool</tt> options all require the presence of programs not included with rEFInd. The <tt>gptsync</tt> option requires use of a like-named program which, although it ships with rEFInd 0.6.9 and later, is not installed by default except under OS X. See the <a href="installing.html#addons">"Installing Additional Components"</a> section of the <a href="installing.html">Installing rEFInd</a> page for pointers to the shell, Memtest86, and <tt>gptsync</tt> programs. The <tt>apple_recovery</tt> option will appear only if you've got an Apple Recovery HD partition (which has a boot loader called <tt>com.apple.recovery.boot/boot.efi</tt>). The <tt>firmware</tt> option works only on computers that support this option; on other computers, the option is quietly ignored.

Higher values are system-specific. Mode <tt>1024</tt> is a rEFInd-specific code that means to <i>not</i> set any mode at all; rEFInd instead uses whatever mode was set when it launched. If you set this option to an invalid value, rEFInd pauses during startup to tell you of that fact. Note that setting <tt>textmode</tt> can sometimes force your graphics-mode resolution to a higher value than you specify in <tt>resolution</tt>.

If you set a resolution that doesn't work on a UEFI-based system, rEFInd displays a message along with a list of valid modes. On an system built around EFI 1.<i>x</i> (such as a Mac), setting an incorrect resolution fails silently; you'll get the system's default resolution. You'll also get the system's default resolution if you set both resolution values to <tt>0</tt> or if you pass anything but two numbers. (Note that passing a resolution with an <tt>x</tt>, as in <tt>1024x768</tt>, will be interpreted as <i>one</i> option and so will cause the default resolution to be used.) If you get a higher resolution than you request, try commenting out or changing the <tt>textmode</tt> value, since it can force the system to use a higher graphics resolution than you specify with <tt>resolution</tt>. Also, be aware that it is possible to set a valid resolution for your video card that's invalid for your monitor. If you do this, your monitor will go blank until you've booted an OS that resets the video mode.</td>

You can enter any substring of the title as the <tt>default_selection</tt>, so long as it's two or more characters in length. It's best to use a unique substring, since rEFInd stops searching when it finds the first match. Because rEFInd sorts entries within a directory in descending order by file modification time, if you specify a directory (or volume name, for loaders in a partition's root directory) as the <tt>default_selection</tt>, the newest loader in that directory will be the default. One-character entries are matched against the first character of the title, except for digits, which refer to the numeric order of the boot loader entries. If you specify a comma-delimited list of names <i><b>in quotation marks,</b></i> rEFInd will search on these in turn until it finds a match. For instance, <tt>default_selection "alpha,beta"</tt> will launch <tt>alpha</tt> if it's available, and <tt>beta</tt> if <tt>alpha</tt> is not available but <tt>beta</tt> is. If the <i>first</i> item in such a list is a plus sign (<tt>+</tt>), that refers to the item that rEFInd launched the last time it ran. You may optionally follow the match string by two times, in 24-hour format, in which case the entry applies only between those two times. For instance, <tt>default_selection Safety 1:30 2:30</tt> boots the entry called <tt>Safety</tt> by default between the hours of 1:30 and 2:30. These times are specified in whatever format the motherboard clock uses (local time or UTC). If the first value is larger than the second, as in <tt>23:00 1:00</tt>, it is interpreted as crossing midnight&mdash;11:00 PM to 1:00 AM in this example. The last <tt>default_selection</tt> setting takes precedence over preceding ones <i>if</i> the time value matches. Thus, you can set a main <tt>default_selection</tt> without a time specification and then set one or more others to override the main setting at specific times. If you do not specify a <tt>default_selection</tt>, rEFInd attempts to boot the previously-booted entry, or the first entry if there's no record of that or if the previously-booted entry can't be found.</td>

<p>Prior to version 0.2.4, rEFInd supported a token called <tt>disable</tt>, whose function partially overlapped with <tt>hideui</tt>. Version 0.2.4 merges many of the features of these two tokens into <tt>hideui</tt> and creates the new <tt>showtools</tt> option, which provides the remaining functionality in a more flexible way.</p>

<p>As an example of rEFInd configuration, consider the following <tt>refind.conf</tt> file:</p>

<pre class="listing">
# Sample refind.conf file
timeout 5
banner custom.bmp
scan_driver_dirs drivers,EFI/tools/drivers
scanfor manual,external,optical
default_selection elilo
</pre>

<p>This example sets a timeout of 5 seconds; loads a custom graphic file called <tt>custom.bmp</tt> from the directory in which the rEFInd binary resides; scans the <tt>drivers</tt> and <tt>EFI/tools/drivers</tt> directories for EFI drivers; uses manual boot loader configuration but also scans for external EFI boot loaders and EFI boot loaders on optical discs; and sets the default boot loader to the first loader found that includes the string <tt>elilo</tt>. Of course, since this file specifies use of manual boot loader configuration, it's not complete; you'll need to add at least one OS stanza to be able to boot from anything but an external disk or optical drive, as described shortly.</p>

<a name="stanzas">
<h2>Creating OS Stanzas</h2>
</a>

<p>OS stanzas in rEFInd are similar to those in GRUB Legacy, GRUB 2, or ELILO. You can use them to add EFI boot loaders to those that are auto-detected. rEFInd does not yet support manual boot stanzas for BIOS-mode boot loaders. You also cannot modify the auto-detected options; if you just want to tweak one OS's configuration, you have several options, none of which is ideal:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can move or rename the boot loader file for the boot loader you want to tweak.</li>

<li>You can disable all auto-detection options and add manual configurations for all your boot loaders, even those that work fine when auto-detected.</li>

<li>You can put up with having duplicate tags in your OS list.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each OS stanza begins with the keyword <tt>menuentry</tt>, a name for the entry, and an open curly brace (<tt>{</tt>). Subsequent lines constitute the bulk of the stanza, which concludes with a line containing nothing but a close curly brace (<tt>}</tt>). Table 2 summarizes the keywords that you can include in a stanza.</p>

You pass this token a filesystem's label, a partition's label, a partition's GUID, or a volume number. A filesystem or partition label is typically displayed under the volume's icon in file managers and rEFInd displays it on its menu at the end of the boot prompt string. If this label isn't unique, the first volume with the specified label is used. The matching is nominally case-insensitive, but on some EFIs it's case-sensitive. If a filesystem has no label, you can use a partition GUID number. You can also use a volume number followed by a colon, such as <tt>0:</tt> to refer to the first filesystem or <tt>1:</tt> to refer to the second. The assignment of numbers is arbitrary and may not be consistent across boots, though. It might change if you insert an optical disc or plug in a USB flash drive, for instance.

<p>As an example, consider the following entries:</p>

<pre class="listing">
menuentry "Ubuntu Linux" {
    loader /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi
    disabled
}

menuentry Gentoo {
    icon \EFI\refind\icons\os_gentoo.icns
    volume G_KERNELS
    loader \kernels\bzImage-3.3.0-rc7
    initrd \kernels\initrd-3.3.0-rc7.img
    options "root=/dev/sda3 ro"
}

menuentry "Windows via shell script" {
    icon \EFI\refind\icons\os_win.icns
    loader \EFI\tools\shell.efi
    options "fs0:\EFI\tools\launch_windows.nsh"
}
</pre>

<p>This example sets up three entries: one for Ubuntu Linux, one for Gentoo Linux, and one to launch a shell script. Note that the first two entries use different directory separators, simply to demonstrate the fact that it's possible. The Ubuntu entry sets no icon, since rEFInd will note that the boot loader is stored in the <tt>ubuntu</tt> directory, and it will automatically find the appropriate Ubuntu icon (<tt>os_ubuntu.icns</tt>). This option is, however, disabled, so no matching icon will appear when you reboot unless you first comment out or delete the <tt>disabled</tt> line.</p>

<p class="sidebar"><b>Tip:</b> Under Linux, you can learn a filesystem's label by using <tt>blkid</tt>, as in <tt class="userinput">blkid /dev/sda1</tt>. The filesystem's label, if set, is identified by the keyword <tt>LABEL</tt> in the output. Some versions also return the partition's label and partition GUID (referred to as <tt>PARTUUID</tt> by <tt>blkid</tt>). You can obtain the partition's name and unique GUID using <tt>sgdisk</tt>, as in <tt class="userinput">sgdisk -i 1 /dev/sda</tt> to find the data on <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>.</p>

<p>The Gentoo entry begins with an icon specification to be sure that the icon is loaded from the same volume as rEFInd. (If the icon were stored on the same filesystem as the kernel, you'd place the <tt>icon</tt> line after the <tt>volume</tt> line.) This entry uses the <tt>volume</tt> token to tell rEFInd to load the kernel and initial RAM disk file from the filesystem or partition called <tt>G_KERNELS</tt>. It passes the filename for an initial RAM disk using the <tt>initrd</tt> line and free-form options using the <tt>options</tt> line. Note that the kernel filename does <i>not</i> include a <tt>.efi</tt> extension, which keeps rEFInd from picking up the kernel file in its auto-scans.</p>

<p>The <tt>Windows via shell script</tt> entry may seem puzzling, but its purpose is to launch an OS (Windows in this case) after performing additional pre-boot initialization, which is handled by an EFI shell script. This works because you can pass the name of a shell script to an EFI shell&mdash;the script is named on the stanza's <tt>options</tt> line, using EFI file notation. The shell script, in turn, does whatever it needs to do and then launches the OS's boot loader:</p>

<pre class="listing">mm 0003003E 8 -pci
fs0:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi</pre>

<p>This example writes data to the computer's PCI bus via the EFI shell's <tt>mm</tt> command and then launches Windows. Chances are you won't need to engage in such operations, and I do <i>not</i> recommend you try this exact example unless you know what you're doing! This command was required to activate the video hardware on a computer of a person with whom I corresponded prior to booting Windows, but such needs are rare. Another example of a similar approach can be found in <a href="http://forum.techinferno.com/diy-e-gpu-projects/printfriendly2367.htm">this forum thread.</a> A few pointers on finding addresses for your hardware can be found <a href="http://forum.techinferno.com/diy-e-gpu-projects/2367-macbook-pro-retina-15-gtx-560-ti-%40-th05-8.html#post36199">in this post.</a></p>

<p>You can combine these OS stanzas with the global <tt>refind.conf</tt> options presented earlier. The result would contain just two entries on the rEFInd boot menu (for Gentoo and Windows, since the Ubuntu entry is disabled), unless rEFInd found other boot options on an external or optical disk.</p>

<a name="submenu">
<h2>Creating Submenu Entries</h2>
</a>

<p>As described on the <a href="using.html">Using rEFInd</a> page, rEFInd can present a menu of options for certain loader tags when you press the Insert, F2, or + key. rEFInd does this automatically when it detects Mac OS X or ELILO boot loaders, or when you set the OS type via the <tt>ostype</tt> option. The Mac OS X boot loader, in particular, accepts various options that you can use to boot in various ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you might want to create your own custom submenu entries, and rEFInd 0.2.1 and later enable you to do this. To create a custom submenu, you use the <tt>submenuentry</tt> keyword <i>inside</i> a <tt>menuentry</tt> stanza. Normally, you'll set the submenu definitions <i>after</i> you've set the main menu options, since the submenu options take the main menu options as defult, and so the main options must be set first. Like a <tt>menuentry</tt> stanza, a <tt>submenuentry</tt> definition begins with the keyword, the name of the item, and an open curly brace (<tt>{</tt>). It continues until a close curly brace (<tt>}</tt>). A submenu definition can use the keywords described in <a href="#table3">Table 3.</a> Except as otherwise noted, using an option of a given name completely overrides the setting in the main stanza.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="2" summary="Table 3: Submenu keywords in <tt>refind.conf</tt>"><a name="table3"><caption><b>Table 3: Submenu keywords in <tt>refind.conf</tt></b></caption></a>
<tr>
   <th>Token</th>
   <th>Possible parameters</th>
   <th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>submenuentry</tt></td>
   <td>name for the entry</td>
   <td>Sets the name that's displayed for this entry on the submenu page. If the name should contain a space, it <i>must</i> be enclosed in quotes. Following the name, an open curly brace (<tt>{</tt>) ends the <tt>submenuentry</tt> line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>loader</tt></td>
   <td>filename</td>
   <td>Sets the filename for the boot loader, as described in <a href="#table2">Table 2.</a> Note that the loader is read from whatever filesystem is specified by the main stanza's <tt>volume</tt> option, provided that option precedes the submenu definition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>initrd</tt></td>
   <td>filename</td>
   <td>Sets the filename for a Linux kernel's initial RAM disk (initrd), as described in <a href="#table2">Table 2.</a> If you want to eliminate the initrd specification, you should use this keyword alone, with no options. You might do this because your main entry is for a Linux kernel with EFI stub support and this submenu entry launches ELILO, which sets the initrd in its own configuration file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>graphics</tt></td>
   <td><tt>on</tt> or <tt>off</tt></td>
   <td>Enables or disables a graphical boot mode, as described in <a href="#table2">Table 2.</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>options</tt></td>
   <td>options passed to the boot loader</td>
   <td>Pass arbitrary options to your boot loader with this line, as described in <a href="#table2">Table 2.</a> As with <tt>initrd</tt>, you can eliminate all options by passing this keyword alone on a line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>add_options</tt></td>
   <td>options passed to the boot loader</td>
   <td>This token works just like <tt>options</tt>, except that instead of <i>replacing</i> the default options, it causes the specified options to be <i>added to</i> those specified in the main stanza listing's <tt>options</tt> line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>disabled</tt></td>
   <td>none</td>
   <td>Disable a submenu entry. This is often easier than commenting out an entire entry if you want to temporarily disable it.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The following menu entry illustrates the use of submenu entries. This is a variant of the second entry presented earlier:</p>

<pre class="listing">
menuentry Gentoo {
    loader \EFI\linux\bzImage-3.3.0-rc7
    initrd \EFI\linux\initrd-3.3.0-rc7.img
    options "root=/dev/sda3 ro"
    icon \EFI\refind\icons\os_gentoo.icns
    submenuentry "single-user mode" {
        add_options "single"
    }
    submenuentry "3.3.0 final release kernel" {
        loader \EFI\linux\bzImage-3.3.0
        initrd \EFI\linux\initrd-3.3.0.img
    }
    submenuentry "boot via ELILO" {
        loader \EFI\elilo\elilo.efi
	initrd
	options
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The main menu item for this entry won't look different with the submenus defined than without them; but if you press the Insert key, you'll see the submenu items:</p>

    <br /><center><img src="manual-submenu.png" align="center" width="372"
    height="272" alt="Manually defining submenus enables you to customize
    your boot options." border=2></center><br />

<p>The main menu item appears at the top of the list&mdash;<tt>Run bzImage-3.3.0-rc7</tt> in this example. The three submenus defined in this example's configuration file appear next, enabling you to launch in single-user mode, run the 3.3.0 release kernel, or boot via ELILO, respectively. Submenus also include an item called <tt>Return to Main Menu</tt> that does just as it says. (Alternatively, you can return to the main menu by pressing the Esc key.)</p>

<p>This example illustrates some of the things you can do with submenu entries:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can add kernel options when booting via the EFI stub loader&mdash;to launch single-user mode, to add graphical boot options, or what have you.</li>

<li>You can change kernel options when booting via the EFI stub loader&mdash;to <i>remove</i> graphical boot options, to boot to a different root device, and so on.</li>

<li>You can change your kernel and/or initial RAM disk when booting via the EFI stub loader.</li>

<li>You can give users a choice of boot loaders. In this example, the main option boots via the kernel stub loader, but the submenu gives users the chance to boot via ELILO instead. In fact, you could even boot two entirely different OSes from manually-defined submenu entries, although that could be confusing.</li>

</ul>
